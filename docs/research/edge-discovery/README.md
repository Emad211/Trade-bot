# Edge Discovery Research Program

This directory is the durable research memory for the trading-system project. It is intentionally independent of the repository's previous market, asset, model, and timeframe choices. No earlier design decision is treated as a constraint unless it is re-established by evidence in this program.

## Objective

Build a defensible path from economic hypotheses to a live trading system without confusing prediction accuracy, backtest profitability, hidden risk premia, or execution assumptions with a genuine exploitable edge.

## Research Tree

### 1. Edge Map

| Report | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|
| [1.1 — Edge Definition and Proof Standard](01-edge-map/01-01-edge-definition-and-proof-standard.md) | Formal definition of edge, evidence hierarchy, hard rejection gates, and required hypothesis contract | Complete |
| [1.2 — Taxonomy of Edge Mechanisms](01-edge-map/01-02-taxonomy-of-edge-mechanisms.md) | Risk premia, behavioral mispricing, information, relative value, liquidity provision, execution, and risk-policy edge | Complete |
| [1.3 — Market, Instrument, Horizon, Competition, and Capacity Map](01-edge-map/01-03-market-instrument-horizon-competition-capacity-map.md) | Where each edge can realistically exist and whether an independent operator can compete | Complete |
| 1.4 — Falsification and Evidence Design | Negative controls, robustness, trial accounting, prospective tests, and kill criteria | Next |
| 1.5 — Edge Map Synthesis | Ranked hypotheses and explicit decisions on what enters replication | Planned |

### 2. Research Replication

### 5. Live Trading System

| Report | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 5.1 | Runtime architecture and state machines | Planned |
| 5.2 | Market connectivity, order management, and execution | Planned |
| 5.3 | Risk engine, reconciliation, and persistence | Planned |
| 5.4 | Monitoring, incident handling, and dry-run operations | Planned |
| 5.5 | Controlled deployment with minimal real capital | Planned |

## Bottom-Up Synthesis Rule

Each leaf report must contain:

1. Problem definition.
2. Evidence supporting and challenging the proposition.
3. Review of relevant production code and engineering practice.
4. Data and timing requirements.
5. Acceptance and rejection criteria.
6. Known limitations and unresolved questions.
7. An explicit implementation consequence.

Five leaf reports form one section-level synthesis. The five section syntheses form the final trading-system research and implementation blueprint.

## Governance Rules

- Every hypothesis, feature family, label, threshold, parameter range, asset, venue, horizon, and metric choice counts toward the research trial ledger.
- Negative results are retained permanently.
- Historical evidence can qualify a candidate for prospective testing but cannot prove a live edge.
- No strategy is promoted because it uses a complex model, a famous paper, or a high backtest Sharpe ratio.
- Data availability time, executable prices, realistic costs, failure modes, and capacity are part of the hypothesis itself.
- The final outcome may legitimately be to reject every candidate.

## Branch

These reports are developed on `agent/edge-research-reports` until the research package is mature enough for review and integration.
